# Making a website

What better way to start a blog than to talk about the process behind creating it?

This website started as a conversation between [Piper](http://piperhaywood.com/) and myself. I had just left my full-time job and PH, being an angel, suggested that we could work together on a new personal website for my practice. It was also a good excuse for us to collaborate and explore some of our ideas about website design and development together.

From the outset, we set the intention that the process should be conversation between the two of us. We're both interested in seeing design and development as a collaborative and iterative process, where both parties learn from the other. (Although, admittedly, I have learnt much more from PH during this process. Oops!)

## Lightness

We think that a website can be modern without being complicated.

Today's web development world can seem incredibly intimidating for someone just starting out. There are so many different frameworks and languages to learn  – something that Jake puts quite succinctly [here](https://twitter.com/jakedowsmith/status/1184125876608352256).

Complexity makes websites more opaque, but it also requires more maintenance and makes them less robust.

## Static

This is a static site built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

``TODO PH – why a static site?``

## Content

All text is edited in Markdown, which we love because it is simple and human-readable, yet also flexible and powerful.

`TODO PH – something about metadata and https://schema.org/`

The _Thinking_ panel hooks into Arena's API. I use Arena every day, and it has become a vital part of my thinking process. Any channel that I add to _My Website_ channel will show up here. We wanted to make something that would amplify my existing workflows rather than create any extra work. We're also using this channel to host any images that I want to add to my blog, as a way of getting around adding another service for image hosting.

## Accessibility

``TODO PH & GC: designing and developing for accessibility from the outset, and why complying with accessibility requirements make your site better for everyone``

## Openness

We have documented both our code and our process on Github. The source code is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/GemCopeland/personal-website/blob/master/LICENSE), and PH has created an in-depth README that also explains things like Git, the command line, static site generators, and other things code-related. Hopefully this is a good resource for others with similar levels of experience and interest.
