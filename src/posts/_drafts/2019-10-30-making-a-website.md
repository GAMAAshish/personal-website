This website started as a conversation between [Piper](http://piperhaywood.com/) and myself. I had just left my full-time job and PH, being an angel, suggested that we could work together on a new personal website for my practice. It was also a good excuse for us to collaborate and explore some of our ideas about website design and development together.

From the outset, we set the intention that the process should be conversation between the two of us. We're both interested in seeing design and development as a collaborative and iterative process, where both parties learn from the other. (Although, admittedly, I have learnt much more from PH during this process.)

## Light

We think that a website can be modern without being complicated.

Today's web development world can seem incredibly intimidating for someone just starting out. There are so many different frameworks and languages to learn, it can feel like it's better just not to start and use a template instead  – something that Jake puts quite succinctly [here](https://twitter.com/jakedowsmith/status/1184125876608352256).

Complexity makes websites more opaque, but it also makes them less robust. The more a site depends on complex frameworks, the more potential points of failure it has, making it harder to maintain over time.

``TODO PH – why a static site?``

This is a static site built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Accessible

Considering as broad an audience as possible from the outset ultimately makes for a better site. It sets restrictions on some visual elements, but I think that working within restrictions in a clever and thoughtful way ultimately makes something more beautiful. As with designing for mobile first, designing for accessibility encourages you to consider the relative importance of each element.

## Structured

All text is edited in Markdown, which we love because it is simple and human-readable, yet also flexible and powerful. Data is structured according to the vocabulary set out by [schema.org](https://schema.org/).

`TODO PH – something about metadata and https://schema.org/`

Using these two syntaxes relates to our ideas around maintaining long-term archives. The front-end of a website is more ephemeral (like the outer layer of a tree), while the back-end should have more longevity. We added as much structure to the data as possible from the outset, even if it isn't currently being utilised. This mindset is more about building an archive of data than a website. It's about seeing archiving as a continuous process rather than a single event.

## Fluid

Connected to this idea of continuous archiving is our choice to, wherever possible, hook into my existing workflows and tools. For example, the _Thinking_ panel uses Arena's API. I use Arena every day, and it has become a vital part of my thinking process. Any channel that I add to _My Website_ channel will show up here. We wanted to make something that would amplify my existing workflows rather than create any extra work. We're also using this channel to host any images that I want to add to my blog, as a way of getting around adding another service for image hosting.

## Open

We have documented both our code and our process on Github. The source code is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/GemCopeland/personal-website/blob/master/LICENSE), and PH has created an in-depth README that also explains things like Git, the command line, static site generators, and other things code-related. Hopefully this is a good resource for others with similar levels of experience and interest.
