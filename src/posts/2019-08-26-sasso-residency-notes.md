excerpt: |
  Casa Sasso is located in Gambarogno, which in the south of Switzerland, right on the border with Italy. It's an large stone house with a huge garden, set on the side of a mountain and overlooking Lake Maggiore. The lake is absolutely enormous – Wikipedia tells me it's 65km long – and straddles three regions, two in Italy and one in Switzerland.

  The weather is mild; interestingly, the weather forecast predicts storms every day, but since we've been here it's been fairly sunny almost every day, with occasional showers. We have a working theory that the residents here bribe the weather forecasters so that tourists stay away – this has yet to be disproven so is probably true.

The clouds sit low, right on top the mountains. One day I walked up our mountain and through the forest, and I was literally walking through the clouds. The air was heavy and humid, and everything was covered in a soft haze. On other days, the lake acts as a container for the clouds to sit inside and they just float there, almost completely still.

In the week since I arrived here, I've been able to do so many things that I've wanted to do for ages. Although most of these activities have some kind of link to my practice, at home I would feel guilty about doing them because they feel inessential, or because I simply don't have the time. It feels so freeing to just do whatever I want with my time. Most of the time it falls somewhere between leisure, education and work.

There are three others here with me for the month. It's incredible how easy and natural it feels to be here with them, to go from complete strangers to spending every moment in the same space. There's this "hum" while working here (an idea borrowed from the founders of Loomio, Rich & Nat) – everyone relaxed and happy to be doing the thing that they love. It feels very productive, but not stressful. There's intense focus and activity, but it feels joyful and easy. There's also quite a literal hum – sometimes I can tell where the others are by hearing them hum or sing or whistle in another room, which is very sweet.
