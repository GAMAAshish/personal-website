I am an interdependent digital designer and researcher.

I have worked in Australia, The Netherlands and the UK, leading digital design projects for a wide range of organisations, primarily within the cultural, social innovation and educational sectors. Most recently, I was the senior digital art director at [Future Corp](#) in London.

I am currently working on [Common Knowledge](#), a workers cooperative of software engineers and designers building digital tools for grassroots activists.

I am part of [Evening Class](#), a design collective and self-organised learning group. Together we develop research around our common interests, write texts, host events, run workshops, work on design projects and support one another.

I am available for collaborations and love talking to new people, so send me an email.
