I am an interdependent digital designer and researcher, currently based in London.

I am a member of [Common Knowledge](http://commonknowledge.coop), a worker cooperative that designs digital tools for and with grassroots activists.

I am also part of the [Designers + Cultural Workers branch](https://twitter.com/UVW_DCW) of United Voices of the World and [Evening Class](https://evening-class.org/), a self-organised learning group.

I have led digital design projects for a range of organisations in Australia, The Netherlands and the UK, most recently at [Future Corp](https://futurecorp.london/) in London.
