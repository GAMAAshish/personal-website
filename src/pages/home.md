I am an interdependent digital designer, currently based in London.

I am a member of [Common Knowledge](http://commonknowledge.coop), a worker cooperative that designs digital tools for and with grassroots activists.

I teach Digital as part of the [BA Graphic Communication Design](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/communication-and-graphic-design/undergraduate/ba-hons-graphic-communication-design-csm) course at Central Saint Martins.

I am also part of the [Designers + Cultural Workers branch](https://twitter.com/UVW_DCW) of United Voices of the World.

I have led digital design projects for a range of organisations in Australia, The Netherlands and the UK, most recently as digital art director at [Future Corp](https://futurecorp.london/).
