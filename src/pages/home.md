I am an interdependent digital designer and researcher.

I am currently working on [Common Knowledge](http://commonknowledge.coop), a worker cooperative that designs digital tools for and with grassroots activists.

I am also part of [Evening Class](https://evening-class.org/), a design collective and self-organised learning group. Together we develop research around our common interests, write texts, host events, run workshops, work on design projects and support one another.

I have worked in Australia, The Netherlands and the UK and have led digital design projects for a wide range of organisations, primarily within the cultural, social innovation and educational sectors. Most recently, I was the senior digital art director at [Future Corp](https://futurecorp.london/) in London.

I am available for collaborations, lectures or workshops, and love talking to new people, so send me an email.
