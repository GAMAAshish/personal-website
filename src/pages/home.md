  This site is set in Standard by Bryce Wilner. Thank you!

  It was built with Eleventy and Arena by the wonderful Piper Haywood, and it is hosted on Netlify. If you’re interested, you can check out the [Github repo](#). Something something something about open source.

I am an interdependent digital designer and researcher.

I have worked in Australia, The Netherlands and the UK, leading digital design projects for a wide range of organisations, primarily within the cultural, social innovation and educational sectors. Most recently, I was the senior digital art director at [Future Corp](#) in London.

I am currently working on [Common Knowledge](#), a workers cooperative of software engineers and designers building digital tools for grassroots activists.

I am part of [Evening Class](#), a design collective and self-organised learning group. Together we develop research around our common interests, write texts, host events, run workshops, work on design projects and support one another.

I am available for collaborations and love talking to new people, so send me an email.
